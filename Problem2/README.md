## ðŸ“„ README.md
I haven't uploaded full trace files yet because some were exceeding 100MB Github limit, but this code gives idea how things work.

## Output ```=> alexnet : 0.687, mobilenet_v2: 0.313``` 
## Answer is yet unclear but will be either of this two class is gauranteed I am processing data again



# ðŸ§© Victim Model Identification (Bit-by-Bit Hackathon)

This repository contains the full pipeline to **identify CNN victim models**  
(such as AlexNet vs MobileNet) using **hardware performance counter traces**  
collected via Linux `perf stat`.

The workflow includes:
- Trace collection
- Cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Model training & evaluation
- Victim prediction



## ðŸš€ Usage

### 1. Collect traces

Collect raw hardware performance counter traces for each model:

```bash
./collect_traces.sh mobilenet 15
./collect_traces.sh alexnet 15
```

This creates CSV logs in `traces/`.

### 2. Clean traces

Convert raw logs into structured CSV:

```bash
python3 clean_all.py
```

### 3. Extract features

Generate features and time-series vectors:

```bash
python3 extract_features.py
```

### 4. Train model

Train RandomForest classifier:

```bash
python3 train_model.py
```

### 5. Predict victim

For unknown victim traces:

```bash
python3 predict_victim.py
```
