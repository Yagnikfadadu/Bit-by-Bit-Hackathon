# ðŸš€ Bit-by-Bit Hackathon â€“ Side-Channel Analysis Project

This repository contains our solution for the **Bit-by-Bit Hackathon**.  
We implemented **Side-Channel Analysis (SCA)** techniques to recover AES secret keys using power/EM traces.  
The project includes scripts for **trace collection, training, prediction, evaluation, and attack execution** using deep learning models (MLP, AlexNet, MobileNet, etc.).
